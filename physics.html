<h1>About Thomas Fuller</h1>
<p>I'm going to be creating something called a "course content aggregator" here</p>
<p>Basically, the way this will work is that I will upload the homework QUESTIONS for my
plasma physics and numerical analysis homeworks.  The aggregator will have a button.  This button is very special.
When you press this button, two things happen.  The first is that a 30 minute timer begins.  The second is that 4 questions
from the class you selected will be displayed.  Your job is to solve all four questions in under 30 minutes.  After the time expires,
or when you click "finished", it will offer you the chance to grade yourself and you can see how you did.  I need a really high GPA this 
semester, so this seems like a side project that can teach me about web programming and also help me learn my class material faster</p>
