<h1>About Thomas Fuller</h1>
<p>My research interests began in Summer of 2010 when I became 
interested in thermoelectric generation.  That summer, I was part of a
team that developed a solar powered Striling engine.  A passively cooled,
clean energy supply.  In 2013, I was part of a team that published a paper
at the IMECE2013 conference discussing the use of shape memory alloys in airfoil control 
surfaces.</p>
