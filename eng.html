<h1>About Thomas Fuller</h1>
<p>My research interests began in Summer of 2010 when I became 
interested in thermoelectric generation.  That summer, I was part of a
team that developed a solar powered Striling engine.  A passively cooled,
clean energy supply.  In 2013, I was part of a team that published a paper
at the IMECE2013 conference discussing the use of shape memory alloys in airfoil control 
surfaces.</p> 

<p> The second phase of my career began in August 2013 when I began studying system and controls
at the University of New Hampshire.  My thesis was entitled "Experimental Celestial Navigation Prototype for Computer
Vision Based Nautical Sight Reduction".  It was a camera that would take a photograph of the stars and output latitude
and longitude.</p>

<p> The third part of my career began in Fall 2016 when I accepted a position as a Ph.D. student at BU.</p>
