anchor: Cusp Model for Magnetic Reconnection Survey Mission
title:  Cusp Model  
image: img/portfolio/cusp.png
description: This model used the Tsyganenko Magnetosphere model and NASA General Mission Analysis Tool (GMAT) to develop a model of how many times a satellite would cross the northern magnetic cusp for a mission of 90 days in duration for various start months and orbital inclinations in the year 2019.  Studied magnetic reconnection, plasma physics and orbital mechanics to do this project.
