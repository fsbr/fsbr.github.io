description: Active Aerodynamic System is an open loop control system using the martensite to austenite transition of nickel titanium alloy (Nitinol) to control the aileron of a model airplane wing.  This led to a poster publication at the ASME IMECE 2013 conference under publication number IMECE2013-65147.  Although I was involved in many aspects of this project, my main contributions were in developing high current relay circuits with Arduino to control the aileron elevation angle as well as constructing prototype wing models.
