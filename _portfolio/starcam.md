description: This project is a star camera that uses two inputs, a picture of the stars, and a measurement of the camera's body orientation to determine the latitude and longitude from where the photograph was taken.  This research was done at the University of New Hampshire's <a href="https://ceps.unh.edu/mechanical-engineering/systems-controls">Advanced Controls Laboratory</a>, and was able to compute location accurate to approximately 3 nautical miles.  This led to publications at the American Astronomical Society publication number AAS 16-509, and a thesis, which can be found <a href="https://github.com/fsbr/startracker-thesis/blob/master/thesis.pdf">here</a>.
